Identification Of Key Regulatory Mechanisms Of Cellular Identity Of Rat Hypothalamic Astrocytes In The Model Of Domestication And Aggression

Using 5' pair-ended single cell RNA sequencing allows comprehensively investigate the transcriptional pattern of individual cells in the sample, analyzing not only the transcriptional activity of genes, but also the activity of transcribing regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers). This allows simultaneous annotate of identified cell clusters  based on marker genes and assess of changes in the regulatory landscape. In addition, it becomes possible to build models of enhancer-promoter functional associations and analyze the regulatory mechanisms of individual genes.
In this work, this method was applied to a unique model â€“ selective breeds of rats Rattus norvegicus, tamed and aggressive towards humans. The hypothalamus, a part of the brain responsible for the regulation of many behavioral programs, including aggression, was chosen as the object of study for this model. The work was focused on the study of astrocytes as integral components of the triple synapse and involved in the formation of many behaviors.
